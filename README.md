ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @markboenigk

I'm a Senior Data Analyst working at Capital One. I'm automating processes and insights in Retail Bank by utilizing Python, Spark, SQL, and Javascript on platforms like Databricks and Snowflake. 

Outside of my work at Capital One im working on several projects around aviation, Formula 1 and AI/ML. Most of the time I'm utilizing AWS services like S3, Lambdas, EC2 or Dynamo DB to let my projects become reality.
